# Write a function that returns the average of the first n numbers, starting at
# 1, including n.

def average_up_to(n):
    # REPLACE THIS CODE:
    pass

# This code will compare your answers to the correct ones:
print(f"{average_up_to(1)=}  <-- this should be 1.0")
print(f"{average_up_to(3)=}  <-- this should be 2.0")
print(f"{average_up_to(10)=}  <-- this should be 5.5")
print(f"{average_up_to(100)=}  <-- this should be 50.5")
